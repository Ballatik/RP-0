	description = <b>Program: Advanced Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>We have a customer requesting a new Communications Satellite over a specified area in the high latitudes. Design a satellite within their specs and launch into an orbit with the proper orbital parameters as outlined in the contract.&br;&br;This contract can be completed as many times as you would like.&br;&br;<b><color=yellow>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.</color></b>&br;&br;<b>The reward of this contract will slowly increase over time but will be reset to 0 after each completion.&br;<b>Current reward is at @rewardFactorPercent % of its nominal value. Elapsed/Expected Days: @elapsedDays / @RP0:expectedDays_GEORepeatComSats<br>Number of Contracts Completed: @index / unlimited</b>
	genericDescription = Put a satellite into the requested orbit.
