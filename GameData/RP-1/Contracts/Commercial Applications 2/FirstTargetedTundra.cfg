	description = <b>Program: Advanced Commercial Applications<br><b>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>A Tundra orbit is a highly elliptical geosynchronous orbit (note: not geostationary orbit) with a high inclination (usually near 63.4) and an orbital period of one sidereal day. A satellite placed in this orbit spends most of its time over a chosen area of the Earth, a phenomenon known as apogee dwell. Place the customer's satellite in a tundra orbit over the desired area. <br><br><b><color=yellow>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.</color>
