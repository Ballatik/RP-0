	description = <b>Program: Crewed Orbit<br>Type: <color=red>CAPSTONE</color></b><br><br>Humans staying in space for longer durations allows for different types of experiments from what we can do with unmanned probes. Utilize your stations to complete these experiments.  NOTE: You may have already collected some or all of this science. If you have, you won't need to collect it again.

	synopsis = Collect all early crewed station science

	completedMessage = This is loads of data! Scientists are extremely happy with the results of your efforts.
